## Search for range

Given an array on integers sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example:

```txt
 0  1  2  3  4
[1, 2, 2, 2, 4] --> [1, 3]
target = 2
```
