## Fibonacci

In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.
Fibonacci series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

```txt
F(n) = n for n < 2,
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1
```

Write a function that finds F(n) given `n` where `n` is the index of the number in the Fibonacci series.
