## Sorted Array to BST

Your are given an array where the elements are **strictly** in increasing (ascending) order. Convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than one.

```txt
                          3               3
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ->       / \    or       / \     or whatever
                        2   4           2   4
                       /     \           \   \
                      1       5           1   5
```
