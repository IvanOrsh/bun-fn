## BFS and DFS

Write a 4 instance methods for Binary Search Tree class to traverse the BST.

1. Method 1: traverse the tree breadth first and return an array that contains all the values of the BST.
2. Method 2: traverse the tree depth first - In-order and return an array that contains all the values of the BST.
3. Method 3: traverse the tree depth first - Pre-order and return an array that contains all the values of the BST.
4. Method 4: traverse the tree depth first - Post-order and return an array that contains all the values of the BST.
