## Data Structure

### Def.

In computer science, a **data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory in a specific format**.
It provides a means to efficiently access, manipulate, and manage the data. Data structures can be simple or complex, depending on the requirements and the type of data being stored.

Each data structure has its own characteristics, operations, and trade-offs, and the choice of data structure depends on the specific problem and the desired performance and functionality.

### Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures

An **abstract data type (ADT)** is an abstraction of a data structure which **provides only the interface** to which a data structure must adhere to.
The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

**Examples**

| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS)                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List              | Dynamic Array, Linked List                                    |
| Queue             | Linked List based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue |
| Map               | Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table                               |
