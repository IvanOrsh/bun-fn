## Queue with Stack

Implement a (FIFO) queue using **only two stacks**.

The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty).

Notes:

1. Your must use only standard operations of a stack (push, pop, peek, size).
2. Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or dequeue as long as you use only stack's standard operations.
