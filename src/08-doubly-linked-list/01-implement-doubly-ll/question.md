## ## Design Doubly Linked List

with the following methods:

- **remove** a node with the node to be removed is given as input
- **insert** a node **before** a particular node (both the node to be inserted and the node before which the insertion is to happen will be given as input). If the node to be inserted
  - is a part of the linked list then shift its place to the desired location
  - a new node node, then insert the new node at the placed desired.
- **remove all the nodes** in a given list which have their value equal to a given value
- **insert a node at a desired position** - The linked list is 0 indexed. If the given node is a node existing in the linked list shift it to the desired position.
  - if the given list is empty, just insert the node as the head
  - if the position is smaller than the size of the list, insert the node at the end.
