## DFS - adjacency list

Your are given an undirected graph stored as **an adjacency list**. 

Write function to traverse this graph using the **Depth First Search** approach:
1. recursively and
2. iteratively.
As you traverse the graph, store the values of the vertices in an array and return this array.
